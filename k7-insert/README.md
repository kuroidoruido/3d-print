## Notes/Tips

- I made these after some try with NaoNack models
  - NaoNack GB model was estimate by PrusaSlicer at 2h19 of printing time and 26.25g of PLA
  - mine 1h26 (-38%) and 11.08g of PLA (-58%)
  - NaoNack model is heavier but also really stronger, it will protect more cartridge, on my side a prioritize printing speed and cost
- my model is thought to be printed with a resolution of 0.30mm to minimize printer head moves
- my model is made for this case: https://www.planetedisque.com/fr/boitier-et-pochette-k7/52-10-boitiers-k7-cassette-deluxe-transparent-6096420469491.html (it seems slightly smaller than standard ones)
